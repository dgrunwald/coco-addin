For windows users, the *.bat files can be used directly (perhaps with
some modification) and the src/Coco.csproj can also be used.

For Unix users, the build*.sh files can be used directly, or the GNU
autoconfig can be used. Using autoconfig is recommended when packaging
Coco/R in standard locations.

   configure
   make
   make install

See configure -help for more information.
