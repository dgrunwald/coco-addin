This SharpDevelop AddIn is a Custom Tool that runs the Coco/R parser generator for C#.
After installing the AddIn, you will find a new file template in the C# category.
This template creates three files: Parser.atg, Parser.frame and Scanner.frame.
Whenever you change Parser.atg inside SharpDevelop or run right-click > Run Custom Tool on it,
Coco/R will be run on it using the two frame files and generate Parser.cs and Scanner.cs.
Coco/R errors and warnings will be displayed in the "Output" pad.

For information on Coco/R, see the help file that is installed by the AddIn into the
Help > Coco/R Help menu.
The Coco version included contains some modifications to the official Coco,
see https://github.com/dgrunwald/coco-csharp/wiki for details.
